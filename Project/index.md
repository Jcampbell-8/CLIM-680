## Introduction

My CLIM 680 project looks at the relationship between ENSO and precipitation. This was chosen to see if there were connections between precipitation anomalies near the equator that correlated with anomalies in teh Western U.S. I also looked at the ENSO Precipitation Index (ESPI) to see if there were any differences between this and just the ENSO Index.

## Data

The datasets used in my project are:

__CMAP Precipitation__
The [CMAP Precipitation]...
__ENSO Index__

__ESPI Index__

## Results and Codes

### Functions
I created a utility called clim_utils.py for doing repetitive tasks used in my analysis.
They included:
* Defining Lats and Lons for plots
* MAKE UP MORE FUNCTIONS!!!!!!!

### Figures

The figures from my notebooks are saved in the "figs" subdirectory and shown in my notebooks.
